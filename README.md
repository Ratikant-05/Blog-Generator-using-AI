# Blog-Generator-using-AI
This is my first Real-time project where I used AI endpoints to generate a blog along with the images according to the blog.  
This project uses plain HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The features of the website are as follows:-
  1. Generate a blog by giving just one prompt to the AI
  2. The AI generates images along with the blog which can be removed by the user, and  resize the image as per their own needs.
  3. Can generate images as per their needs from their prompt itself or can upload their images.
  4. Drag and drop functionality for images from the chat section to the blog.
  5. A beautiful and visually appealing landing page to attract the user.
